- gonna be a bug with random sort and show more :/
  - look at payload size for API requests. if reasonable, consider prefetching like 200 results. semi-fixes this issue.
    - 50 rms: 5KB
    - 50 users: 1.3 KB
    - 1 active user: 5.5 KB
    - 50 policies: 1.5 KB
    - so prefetching would not be unreasonable, but it'd require some non-trivial code changes in gnarly places
- ooh, should search also search all the fromto titles in a multimove? Would be useful, but possibly confusing.
- bug: PREDIRECT is not collapsing with PRIMARYREDIRECT. Issue with expansion sometimes using WP and sometimes using Wikipedia:. :/
- Err: 'Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in the componentWillUnmount method. in RMs'.
  - I guess I should cancel any pending API calls in componentWillUnmount()?
- in Articles view, add a column with a list of alternative titles considered?
- list move history in Article view? That'd be sick.
- reverse recency sort in article view? Seems more natural to want to read from oldest to newest in this context.
- article search/lookup? (I guess RM search provides a similar ability)
- include Article as column in RMTables, with link to /articles/ lookup page, if it has more than one RM? (and maybe a +n indicator, similar to multimoves?)
  - except in the article lookup view itself

== Wild ideas ==
- have pages for individual RMs? Would give space to show more detailed stats, esp:
  - all votes cast
  - all policies cited 
  - all involved pages, in case of a multimove
- turn the activity stats (noms/closes/comments) in user view into a little bar graph
  - and maybe some kind of viz for polcounts too
- filtering by date range
- what about a 'current title' column?
- search within user view? that'd be a trip.
- votecounts column would be cool
- maybe merge the RMs and RM search views?
- biggest multimoves view?
- some slightly fancy stuff with routing such that e.g. the radio buttons in /rms change the path?
- policy search? (with hypercomplete)
- redlinks for non-existent policy shortcuts?
- in policy lookup view, show total n mentions somewhere
  - would also be nice to show aliases, maybe? (especially now that we're silently collapsing down to the canonical shortcut by default, for the purposes of this view)

== Visual nice-to-haves ==
- in /policies Policy column, make anchor part of link a little smaller
- theoretically would be kinda nice if users view sorting worked via clicking column headings rather than radio buttons
- grey out close/nominated radios in user view if there are none to see
- 'advanced mode' controls
  - show misparsed RMs
  - show more/all columns
- mimic Vector CSS
- title text expansion of policy shortcuts in PolCounts (user view)
- add .active classes to nav items when appropriate

== Backend ==
- Not that it matters that much, but might be able to improve performance of some of pandas queries on the backend by using top_n rather than sort_values+head
- sqlite backend (though actually, pandas backend seems perfectly serviceable right now in terms of response time and memory usage)
- Toolforge does have a redis thing that we could hook into (https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Toolforge#Redis). Theoretically, could be helpful for certain common queries (basically everything other than the search/lookup endpoints). But again, kind of a solution in search of a problem.
- unit tests of some sort?

== Scraping ==
- Try to generally only take content between <!-- RM Top --> and bottom markers. (Unless there's a recognized template outside, such as for MRV, or RM/dated). Some cases where an RM was measured as much bigger than it was because it began inside an existing discussion thread.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin/Archive_15#Witness_number_9_statement_released
  - weird case where RM top and bottom templates were used for a survey that was clearly unrelated to any RM.
- /articles/Yogurt
  - we find only 3 RMs. According to oldmoves template at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yogurt, there should be 8. (Though probably at least 1 was informal)
