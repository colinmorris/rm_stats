- /About
- figure out what to do with home url
- gonna be a bug with random sort and show more :/
 - look at payload size for API requests. if reasonable, consider prefetching like
    200 results. semi-fixes this issue.

== Wild ideas / Nice-to-haves ==
- have pages for individual RMs? Would give space to show more detailed stats, esp:
  - all votes cast
  - all policies cited 
  - all involved pages, in case of a multimove
- turn the activity stats (noms/closes/comments) in user view into a little bar graph
  - and maybe some kind of viz for polcounts too
- filtering by date range
- sqlite backend
- what about a 'current title' column?
- search within user view? that'd be a trip.
- votecounts column would be cool
- maybe merge the RMs and RM search views?
- biggest multimoves view?
- some slightly fancy stuff with routing such that e.g. the radio buttons in /rms change the path?
- policy search?
- redlinks for non-existent policy shortcuts?
- in policy lookup view, show n mentions somewhere
  - would also be nice to show aliases, maybe?

== Visual nice-to-haves ==
- in /policies Policy column, make anchor part of link a little smaller
- theoretically would be kinda nice if users view sorting worked via clicking column headings rather than radio buttons
- grey out close/nominated radios in user view if there are none to see
- make 'show more' a bit less jarring. Maybe a transition. Maybe a thick separating line between last batch and new batch.
- 'advanced mode' controls
  - show misparsed RMs
  - show more/all columns
- mimic Vector CSS
- css transitions!
- title text expansion of policy shortcuts in PolCounts (user view)

== Backend ==
- Not that it matters that much, but might be able to improve performance of some of pandas queries on the backend by using top_n rather than sort_values+head

== Views ==
RMs:
x big RMs / recent RMs
x user lookup
  - !vote
x RM search
x policy lookup
  - n mentions
Columns for all:
* RM
* Date
* outcome
* (maybe) size
Optional columns for all?:
* policy mentions
* all size cols (participants, comments, bytes)
* nominator
* closer
* n_relists


Users:
x top users
Policies:
x top policies
  - also maybe this could be a subview of the user lookup view?!
Other:
- 'home'
- about
