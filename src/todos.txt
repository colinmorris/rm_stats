- don't show table expander button if we're not at limit
- figure out what to do with rows having major parsing errors (no fromto)
  - probably don't show them, unless in some kind of debugging/development mode
- maybe merge the RMs and RM search views?
- return more semantic error codes for certain error conditions in backend
  - e.g. 404 if we get a user lookup for a username that's not in the db?
  - for a failed user lookup, show user lookup search bar
- filtering controls for user view (closer/commenter/nominator)
- /About

== Column display stuff ==
- replace None with ? for to_title
- add "(and x more)" to RM col for multimoves
- clean up outcome col
  - normalize case
  - maybe linkify page names?
  - remove [[link]] markup
- color-code !Vote column in user view to show close/nom?
  - ooh, color code support/oppose !votes and moved/not moved cells
    in matching color scheme, to easy see rough agreement/disagreement.
- in policies view, maybe have polname link to local subpage, and have some kind of ? icon that links to the external policy page? Or just a separate column - lots of horizontal space to spare.

== Views ==
RMs:
x big RMs / recent RMs
x user lookup
  - !vote
x RM search
x policy lookup
  - n mentions
Columns for all:
* RM
* Date
* outcome
* (maybe) size
Optional columns for all?:
* policy mentions
* all size cols (participants, comments, bytes)
* nominator
* closer
* n_relists


Users:
x top users
Policies:
x top policies
  - also maybe this could be a subview of the user lookup view?!
Other:
- 'home'
- about

== Backend ==
- filter/sort kwargs

== Wild ideas / Nice-to-haves ==
- have pages for individual RMs? Would give space to show more detailed stats, esp:
  - all votes cast
  - all policies cited 
  - all involved pages, in case of a multimove
- turn the activity stats (noms/closes/comments) in user view into a little bar graph
  - and maybe some kind of viz for polcounts too
- filtering by date range
- sqlite backend
- mimic Vector CSS
