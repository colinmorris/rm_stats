- make tables expandable
- filtering / sorting controls
- navigation (links at top?)
- figure out what to do with rows having major parsing errors (no fromto)
  - probably don't show them, unless in some kind of debugging/development mode

== Column display stuff ==
- niceify date display
- replace None with ? for to_title
- add "(and x more)" to RM col for multimoves
- clean up outcome col
  - normalize case
  - maybe linkify page names?
  - remove [[link]] markup

== CSS ==
- general table formatting stuff
  - visible borders?
  - margin/padding btwn cols
  - orientation/size of text. Allowing long text to flow over multiple lines.

== Views ==
RMs:
- big RMs / recent RMs
- user lookup
  - !vote
- RM search
- (done) policy lookup
  - n mentions
Columns for all:
* RM
* Date
* outcome
* (maybe) size
Optional columns for all?:
* policy mentions
* all size cols (participants, comments, bytes)
* nominator
* closer
* n_relists


Users:
- top users
Policies:
- top policies
  - also maybe this could be a subview of the user lookup view?!
Other:
- 'home'
- about

== Backend ==
- filter/sort kwargs
- sqlite backend?

== Wild ideas ==
- have pages for individual RMs? Would give space to show more detailed stats, esp:
  - all votes cast
  - all policies cited 
  - all involved pages, in case of a multimove
