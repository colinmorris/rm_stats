- figure out what to do with rows having major parsing errors (no fromto)
  - also outcome=null, cf. field_parser.js constructor
  - probably don't show them, unless in some kind of debugging/development mode
  - maybe add some 'advanced mode' controls for this and other things?
- maybe merge the RMs and RM search views?
- return more semantic error codes for certain error conditions in backend
  - e.g. 404 if we get a user lookup for a username that's not in the db?
  - for a failed user lookup, show user lookup search bar
- filtering controls for user view (closer/commenter/nominator)
- /About
- figure out what to do with home url
- gonna be a bug with random sort and show more :/
- biggest multimoves view?
- some slightly fancy stuff with routing such that e.g. the radio buttons in /rms change the path?

== Column display stuff ==
- replace None with ? for to_title
- color-code !Vote column in user view to show close/nom?
  - ooh, color code support/oppose !votes and moved/not moved cells
    in matching color scheme, to easy see rough agreement/disagreement.
- in policies view, maybe have polname link to local subpage, and have some kind of ? icon that links to the external policy page? Or just a separate column - lots of horizontal space to spare.
  - same thing with policies in user view
  - ooh, title text with expansion of shortcut would be really nice!

== Backend ==
- filter/sort kwargs

== Wild ideas / Nice-to-haves ==
- have pages for individual RMs? Would give space to show more detailed stats, esp:
  - all votes cast
  - all policies cited 
  - all involved pages, in case of a multimove
- turn the activity stats (noms/closes/comments) in user view into a little bar graph
  - and maybe some kind of viz for polcounts too
- filtering by date range
- sqlite backend
- mimic Vector CSS
- what about a 'current title' column?
- css transitions!
- search within user view? that'd be a trip.
- votecounts column would be cool
- grey out close/nominated radios in user view if there are none to see
- somehow merging shortcut aliases (e.g. WP:COMMONNAME | WP:UCRN)
- make 'show more' a bit less jarring. Maybe a transition. Maybe a thick separating line between last batch and new batch.

== Views ==
RMs:
x big RMs / recent RMs
x user lookup
  - !vote
x RM search
x policy lookup
  - n mentions
Columns for all:
* RM
* Date
* outcome
* (maybe) size
Optional columns for all?:
* policy mentions
* all size cols (participants, comments, bytes)
* nominator
* closer
* n_relists


Users:
x top users
Policies:
x top policies
  - also maybe this could be a subview of the user lookup view?!
Other:
- 'home'
- about
